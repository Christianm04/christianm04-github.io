### CPSC 120-11

* Lab 8

  Lab 8, part 3 was my favorite lab because of how cool the end result was. There wasn't much critical thinking for this part of the lab since half of it was copy paste and the other was inserted through the namespace. But, the labs result was super cool to see, the only downside is that it wasn't technically Christmas season yet.
  
* Lab 7

  Lab 7, part 2 was my next favorite lab because I love he game of blackjack. I've been to the casino a few times and blackjack seem to always treat me right so I like it. The lab was a cool little twist on the actual game and I wish we could have involved a random number generator to incorperate the dealers cards.

* Lab 12

  Lab 12, part 1 was my third favorite lab because of how interesting the implication of gifs was in a flipbook style of animation. The color pattern was pretty looking and I remember looking at our produced image so carefully to see if all the colors were actually moving the same way. The lab was overall a fun time and I would love to implicate it in different ways.
